The original recipe was developed in the 1970s, at a cafe in San Sebastian called La Vina. I adapted it to fit a standard cake pan rather than the large springform pan used in the original. I rarely post a trendy recipe while it's still trendy. But this "burnt" cheesecake method deserves the hype and is just plain easier ‚Äî just remember the parchment paper.`,
